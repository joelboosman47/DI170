# Challenge 1: Letter Index Dictionary
# Goal: Create a dictionary that stores the indices (number of the position) of each letter in a word provided by the user(input()).

# Instructions:
# 1. User Input:
# Ask the user to enter a word.
# Store the input word in a variable.

# 2. Creating the Dictionary:
# Iterate through each character of the input word using a loop.
# And check if the character is already a key in the dictionary.
#     * If it is, append the current index to the list associated with that key.
#     * If it is not, create a new key-value pair in the dictionary.
# Ensure that the characters (keys) are strings.
# Ensure that the indices (values) are stored in lists.

# 3. Expected Output:
# For the input “dodo”, the output should be: {"d": [0, 2], "o": [1, 3]}.
# For the input “froggy”, the output should be: {"f": [0], "r": [1], "o": [2], "g": [3, 4], "y": [5]}.
# For the input “grapes”, the output should be: {"g": [0], "r": [1], "a": [2], "p": [3], "e": [4], "s": [5]}.

user_input = input("Please enter a word: ") #take the user input and store it in a variable

word_dict = {} #create empty dictionary

index = 0 #keep track of the index so we can use it
for i in user_input: #iterate through each letter of the input
    if word_dict.get(i, False) == False: #use the get() methode to check if the key already exists
        word_dict[i] = [index] #if not, add the current index as value (stored as list) for the letter as key
    else: #if the key already exists (letter appears more than once in word)
        word_dict.get(i).append(index) #get the current value of the key (list) and add the index to this list  
    index += 1 #after each iteration (letter) we up the index

print(word_dict) #test the code

# Challenge 2: Affordable Items
# Goal: Create a program that prints a list of items that can be purchased with a given amount of money.

# Instructions:
# 1. Store Data:
# You will be provided with a dictionary (items_purchase) where the keys are the item names and the values are their prices (as strings with a dollar sign). The priority is defined by the position of the iten on the dictionary: from the most important to the less important.
# You will also be given a string (wallet) representing the amount of money you have.

# 2. Data Cleaning:
# You need to clean the dollar sign and the commas using python. Don’t hard code it.

# 3. Determining Affordable Items:
# create a list called basket and add there the items that you can buy with the money you have on the wallet
# Don’t forget to update the wallet after buying an item.
# If the basket is empty (no items can be afforded), return the string “Nothing”.
# Otherwise, print the basket list in alphabetical order.

# 4. Examples:
# Given:
# items_purchase = {"Water": "$1", "Bread": "$3", "TV": "$1,000", "Fertilizer": "$20"}
# wallet = "$300"
# The output should be: ["Bread", "Fertilizer", "Water"].

# Given:
# items_purchase = {"Apple": "$4", "Honey": "$3", "Fan": "$14", "Bananas": "$4", "Pan": "$100", "Spoon": "$2"}
# wallet = "$100"
# The output should be: ["Apple", "Bananas", "Fan", "Honey", "Spoon"].

# Given:
# items_purchase = {"Phone": "$999", "Speakers": "$300", "Laptop": "$5,000", "PC": "$1200"}
# wallet = "$1"
# The output should be: "Nothing".

#example1:
items_purchase = {"Water": "$1", "Bread": "$3", "TV": "$1,000", "Fertilizer": "$20"}
wallet = "$300"

#clean the values
wallet = int(wallet.removeprefix('$'))

for key, value in items_purchase.items():
    value = value.removeprefix('$')
    value = value.replace(',', '')
    items_purchase[key] = int(value)

#basket
basket = []

for key, value in items_purchase.items():
    if value <= wallet:
        basket.append(key)
        wallet -= value
    else: continue

#print result
if len(basket) > 0:
    print(basket)
else: print('Nothing')
